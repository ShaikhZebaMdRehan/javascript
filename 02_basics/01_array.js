/* The Array object in programming (like in JavaScript), lets you store many items together using one variable name. Just like in other programming languages, it's a way to keep a list of things (like numbers or names) in one place.

It contains a mix of different data types.

JavaScript arrays are zero-indexed: the first element of an array is at index 0, the second is at index 1, and so on.

JavaScript array-copy operations create shallow copies. (All standard built-in copy operations with any JavaScript objects create shallow copies, rather than deep copies).

A shallow copy of an object is a copy whose properties share the same references.

A deep copy of an object is a copy whose properties do not share the same references. */
